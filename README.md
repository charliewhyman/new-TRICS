## Introduction

TRICS® is the system of trip generation analysis for the UK and Ireland. The TRICS® database includes over 8,000 transport surveys, including inbound and outbound traffic and multi-modal counts. 

TRICS survey data is provided in the form of trip rates, which show the number of movements in and out of a development for a particular factor. This factor is typically per dwelling for residential developments, and per 100sqm of Gross Floor Area for other developments.

Transport consultants use trip rates to estimate the number of trips that will be generated by a new development.

The TRICS website allows export to csv; however, the output file is not provided as a flat table, and can therefore be difficult to analyse. This tool aims to automatically transform the TRICS output into a flat table format.
